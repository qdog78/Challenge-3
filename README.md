This assignment was to create a Password generator, that has special characters, numbers, uppercase and lowecase letters. Using coding mathematics it made it possible that each code is unique. The codes are to be between 8 and 128 characters. The generator is supposed to Prompt you to choose what you want in your code. In this assignment the CSS and HTML were already developed. The JavaScript just needed to be repaired. 

The employer will be happy with the program I developed.
